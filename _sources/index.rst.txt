Beyond Warming - Improved Weightless food service by repurposing temperatures and sauces
==========================================================================================

A process and prototyped device is proposed to handle pre-prepared and novel cuisine offerings 
that use electronics to manage temperature and enhance visual presentation of food in weightless, resource minimized environments like earth orbit.

The innovation proposed involves a single device combining some aspects of 
a **wok, refrigerator, oven and table setting** into one single user device. 

But the specific notion of making 
food 'components' by layer, using an extrapolated concept of sauces is the central issue.

The belief system here is that novel apparatus and preparation ( before lift ), can 
make foods which are browned, toasted, or baked quite routine. This involves moderate
changes to the packaging and the existence of the combining apparatus.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How food is combined, matters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Visualizing even simple foods as a series of components and ignoring preparation 
is how an obsession with nutrition alone can made make institutional food depressing.

Clearly a grilled cheese sandwich can be subjectively, be much more then just 
its 'parts'.

But then if ... **Well combined:**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An improved process for food preparation is the point, not simply a fancy hotplate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Food prepared for using this apparatus in flight has packaging and configuration 
modalities to allow the mix and match of sauces to base meals while retaining layering
familiar in prepared cuisines. The concept of a 'sauce' is extended somewhat to
include layers of additional edible products; In the context of extending the types
of foods and maximizing there appeal possible, the so called sauces are 
**much more important**
then there role in ordinary food preparation. 

Opened packages built with stabilized foods, ( using inert gases ) can be subsequently 
chilled to extend there palatable status until enjoyed. Sort term, this is a minor usage
motif, yet it has subtle utility for food created and combined where planetary support
is much less available.


This is '**Beyond warming**'; The viscosity of sauces and their offered surface tension is 
utilized to enable previously hard to provision foods like eggs, pancakes and waffles. 

Well constructed sauces of all sorts supplement water infused vacuum packet portions 
in weightlessness. 

Heat can be both
added and removed using a semiconductor platen. The range of temperature is bounded
between -15 C and 200 C and the portion size is generally a single adult serving.


The sauces are provisioned in prepared packages which disappear into the servings, 
they are constructed of casien, an edible milk by-product. 

A longer term agenda is built into a serving controlling apparatus along these lines 
quite naturally. Locally grown or synthesized products may benefit from reduced 
temperature. By possibly interfacing to a space heat sinked manifold, energy 
expenditures can be made trivial.   All sorts of food prep tricks can be folded 
into the idea. The goal is a pan like closed device of considerable flexibility. 
But the secret, like the old saying, is in the sauce...


----------------------------
Goals
----------------------------

Clearly, earth orbit habitation is reasonably well understood and a few
milestones are easy to define. When involving people, food and other 
consumables are major line items, to say the lest, of the programme's
success or failure.


************************************************************
Short term - Better packaged food experiences on I.S.S.
************************************************************

A better food experience in earth orbit for foods prepared on earth sent and 
served in moderate time frames. This innovation may visualize application over
a few ones of years from the present moment.


****************************************************************************
Medium term - Working with thermal management for lunar and beyond safaris
****************************************************************************

Some mix of food sourcing from foods grown / built in space may benefit from
'taking food seriously', not just some liability required to maintain human 
life... and utilize space as a heatsink to work with cooling as opposed to 
extreme packaging. Surprisingly, 
`Peltier cooling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling>`_. 
matters to reach thermal
equilibria between food and the very plentiful space, of `space' outside. This is
far beyond a simple operational investigation of a device and food packaging motif;
However one purpose of this blue sky project expenditure is get ready for what's possible
`next', and a manifold through the hull of a spacecraft for food preservation is fairly
obvious.



*********************************************************************************
Long term - Food production, rendering and presentation in variable environments
*********************************************************************************
Aesthetic, Nutrition, and Planning of food sourcing may benefit from more
technology support that involves using preferences and single serving motifs
to inform off planet food production.


For instance, supporting planning for plant and fish grown in situ may benefit
from a continuous, casual 'A.I.' approach towards understanding what each resident
and/or traveler will probably demand or require. Serving systems that mix and match
urges with out wasting materials are the goals, not 'paperwork' and pre-planned menus.

Similarly, some off planet living may strongly suggest fortified foods. The 
proposal here most food servings combine layers of material, that is, an extrapolated
role for 'sauces', is a fine way to sneak in specific nutrients without making eating
and choosing feel repressive !
