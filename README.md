Title: A proposal regarding space food preparation submitted Q3 2021

# The intersection of space-based and terrestrial food production
Food is a critical component of all human space exploration missions; but even more so for future missions to the Moon and Mars. As space missions increase in duration and extend further away from Earth there is a need to reduce the resupply of food from Earth while at the same time provide astronauts enjoyable, yet nutritious foods, to ensure they remain at their physical and psychological best. Innovative food systems that maximize safe and nutritious food outputs, with minimal inputs, will be key for sustainable human presence on the lunar surface and for future missions to Mars.

# Proposal Abstract
A process and prototyped device is proposed to handle pre-prepared and novel cuisine offerings that use electronics to manage temperature and enhance visual presentation of food in weightless, resource minimized environments like earth orbit.

The innovation proposed involves a single device combining some aspects of a wok, refrigerator, oven and table setting into one single user device.

But the specific notion of making food 'components' by layer, using an extrapolated concept of sauces is the central issue.

The belief system here is that novel apparatus and preparation ( before lift ), can make foods which are browned, toasted, or baked quite routine. This involves moderate changes to the packaging and the existence of the combining apparatus.
